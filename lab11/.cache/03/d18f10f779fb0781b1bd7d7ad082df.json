A sequential model is any model where the\n * outputs of one layer are the inputs to the next layer, i.e. the model\n * topology is a simple 'stack' of layers, with no branching or skipping.\n *\n * This means that the first layer passed to a `tf.Sequential` model should have\n * a defined input shape. What that means is that it should have received an\n * `inputShape` or `batchInputShape` argument, or for some type of layers\n * (recurrent, Dense...) an `inputDim` argument.\n *\n * The key difference between `tf.model` and `tf.sequential` is that\n * `tf.sequential` is less generic, supporting only a linear stack of layers.\n * `tf.model` is more generic and supports an arbitrary graph (without\n * cycles) of layers.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n * ```js\n * const model = tf.sequential();\n *\n * // First layer must have an input shape defined.\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}));\n * // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));\n *\n * // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output, which equals\n * // `[null, 4]`. The 1st dimension is the undetermined batch dimension; the\n * // 2nd is the output size of the model's last layer.\n * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));\n * ```\n *\n * It is also possible to specify a batch size (with potentially undetermined\n * batch dimension, denoted by \"null\") for the first layer using the\n * `batchInputShape` key. The following example is equivalent to the above:\n *\n * ```js\n * const model = tf.sequential();\n *\n * // First layer must have a defined input shape\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, batchInputShape: [null, 50]}));\n * // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));\n *\n * // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output.\n * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));\n * ```\n *\n * You can also use an `Array` of already-constructed `Layer`s to create\n * a `tf.Sequential` model:\n *\n * ```js\n * const model = tf.sequential({\n *   layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}),\n *            tf.layers.dense({units: 4})]\n * });\n * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));\n * ```\n *\n * @doc {heading: 'Models', subheading: 'Creation'}\n */\n\n\nfunction sequential(config) {\n  return new _models.Sequential(config);\n}\n/**\n * Load a model composed of Layer objects, including its topology and optionally\n * weights.

A sequential model is any model where the\n * outputs of one layer are the inputs to the next layer, i.e. the model\n * topology is a simple 'stack' of layers, with no branching or skipping.\n *\n * This means that the first layer passed to a `tf.Sequential` model should have\n * a defined input shape. What that means is that it should have received an\n * `inputShape` or `batchInputShape` argument, or for some type of layers\n * (recurrent, Dense...) an `inputDim` argument.\n *\n * The key difference between `tf.model` and `tf.sequential` is that\n * `tf.sequential` is less generic, supporting only a linear stack of layers.\n * `tf.model` is more generic and supports an arbitrary graph (without\n * cycles) of layers.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n * ```js\n * const model = tf.sequential();\n *\n * // First layer must have an input shape defined.\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}));\n * // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));\n *\n * // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output, which equals\n * // `[null, 4]`. The 1st dimension is the undetermined batch dimension; the\n * // 2nd is the output size of the model's last layer.\n * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));\n * ```\n *\n * It is also possible to specify a batch size (with potentially undetermined\n * batch dimension, denoted by \"null\") for the first layer using the\n * `batchInputShape` key. The following example is equivalent to the above:\n *\n * ```js\n * const model = tf.sequential();\n *\n * // First layer must have a defined input shape\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, batchInputShape: [null, 50]}));\n * // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.\n * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));\n *\n * // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output.\n * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));\n * ```\n *\n * You can also use an `Array` of already-constructed `Layer`s to create\n * a `tf.Sequential` model:\n *\n * ```js\n * const model = tf.sequential({\n *   layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}),\n *            tf.layers.dense({units: 4})]\n * });\n * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));\n * ```\n *\n * @doc {heading: 'Models', subheading: 'Creation'}\n */\nexport function sequential(config?: SequentialArgs): Sequential {\n  return new Sequential(config);\n}\n\n/**\n * Load a model composed of Layer objects, including its topology and optionally\n * weights.
